# 🔄 Control Structures: Loops
<br>

## `for` Loop

**1 🔢 Odd Numbers**
- Create a program that console logs the odd numbers between 0 and 20.

**2 📀 Playlist**
- Create a program that prompts the user to enter the name of a playlist and the number of songs they want to add to it. Then, ask to add the chosen number of songs one by one. Display the remaining number of songs to be added and the playlist with the updated songs as it gets updated. Finally, show a message with the playlist name and the list of songs when finished.

**3 🔍 Greater or Lesser Number**
- Create a program that asks whether to find the greater or lesser number from a set. Then, ask how many numbers to search among. Prompt to enter each chosen number one by one, and finally display the greater or lesser number among all the entered numbers as chosen.

**4 ❗️ Factorial**
- Create a program that prompts to enter a number and displays its factorial. The factorial is calculated by multiplying the number and all the numbers preceding it down to 1. For example, 4 ⇒ 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

**5 🏃‍♀️ Race**
- Create a program to track a athlete's laps. Prompt the user for the number of laps to be performed and ask for the time in seconds for each lap. Finally, display a message listing the times for each lap and the average time for the laps (sum of laps / number of laps).
Example:

```
Number of laps: 3
Lap 1: 133s
Lap 2: 145s
Lap 3: 166s
⏱ Average: 144.45s
```


**6 ✊🤚✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors II**
- To the original **Rock, Paper, Scissors** exercise with *conditionals*, add the option to play as many rounds as desired. For each round, display both plays (user and computer), who won the round, current partial score, and remaining rounds. At the end, indicate the overall winner.
Example:

```
Round: 2 of 5
🙍‍♀️ Player: Rock
👾 Computer: Scissors
Player won this round 🎉
Score: 2 (Player) - 0 (Computer)
```


**7 📐 Pattern**
- Create a program that displays the following pattern in the console:

```bash
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
**********
***********
************
*************
```

## `WHILE`Loop

**8🔐 Multiple Attempts**
- Create a program that asks for a username and password. The program should allow up to 3 attempts if the username and/or password are incorrect. If both are entered correctly before 3 incorrect attempts, display a welcome message. If 3 incorrect attempts are made, show an error message and end the program. The username and password should already be stored in variables.

**9💲 Heads or Tails**
- Create a program that allows choosing between heads or tails. The program should then generate a random result and display whether it was guessed correctly or not. In each round, show how many consecutive correct rounds there are, and if there is an error at any point, reset the counter to 0. Also, keep track of the maximum number of consecutive correct rounds. When entering the word "EXIT" instead of HEADS or TAILS, the program should display the maximum number of consecutive correct rounds along with a farewell message and terminate its execution.
 
**10⚖️ Greater or Lesser** 
- Create a program that randomly chooses a number between 1 and 10. The program should then prompt the user to try to guess the number. For each attempt, inform whether the number to guess is greater or lesser than the entered number. The program should end when the number is guessed.
